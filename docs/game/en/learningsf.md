If you have no wood or stone in your wood-cutter and stone quarry, other players stealnothing from you, and only receive the bonus that the game gives them. The amount of that bonus depends on the level of your woodcutter and stone quarry, so the higher the level of those, the better the chances other players will be motivated to attack you.

## Part I  The Basics

### Chapter 1 Getting Started

####  1.1 Choosing a character class

​    People often ask which class is the best. There is no right answer, but each of them has its pros and cons. Knowing those can help you make a choice that suits
your play-style and is strong in the parts of the game  you find most important.

### Chapter 2 Founding the Fortress

 Once you reach level 25 you will be allowed to build the Fortress building. It’s the main one in the Fortress screen and determines the wood and stone capacity
of your storage.

​    The level of the Fortress building also determines the amount of wood and stone rewards you get from wheel of fortune, dice or quests during the Fortress event.

   This is an important point, so will get back to it again later.

#### 2.1 What not to build

Without further ado, we have to first tell you which buildings to keep at level 1 forever and never upgrade beyond that:

- Never upgrade Fortification wall!
- Never upgrade mage Tower!
- Never upgrade Archery!
- Never buy Archers and Mages, only buy Soldiers!

​    Consider that not building defense buildings or units is a sacred law that should never be broken. Actually you don’t have to take our word for it, as there is a
reasonable explanation.

  Every time someone attacks and defeats your Fortress, you get 24 hour protection. During that time other players can’t steal anything from your main storage, they only take 50% of your woodcutter and stone quarry (also called resource buildings),and also a bonus that is not substracted from your resources, but is given to them by the game, out of thin air. With each attack your protection is extended with another 24 hours, and as that usually happens every 5 minutes, it last almost forever (as long as people continue attacking you).

​    If you have no wood or stone in your woodcutter and stone quarry, other players steal nothing from you, and only receive the bonus that the game gives them. The amount of that bonus depends on the level of your woodcutter and stone quarry, so the higher the level of those, the better the chances other players will be motivated to attack you.

​     On the other hand, if you upgrade the wall or build defense units, less people will attack you. Thus protection won’t be extended and will expire. And when someone attacks you without protection, they steal 10% of your main storage, which is much more than the 50% in your resource buildings (which are usually empty anyway).

​     Not only that, but you will also have less chances to counter-attack, as few people will attack you in the first place, because of the strong defense.

​    Also, have in mind that the amount of resources you receive from fortress attacks also depends on the Fortress level of yourself and your opponent. If your opponent has equal or higher Fortress level than you, then you get the full attack amount. If his Fortress level is lower than yours the amount is reduced, and if the difference is more than 3 levels, you win nothing.

#### 2.2 Early build order

​    Once you build Fortress level 1, you can buy the Fortress mushroom pack. It gives you 100000 wood and 50000 stone. Most important things to build with those resources are Fortress level 6 and Hall of Knights 6 (HoK 6).

   Total guild HoK is important as it influences the stats of gems everyone in the guild receives. And getting better gems early helps to defeat dungeons, raids and portals faster.

For this reason you could first use the resources from the Fortress pack to build:

  Table 2.1: How to use Fortress mushroom pack

| Building      | Level | Wood  | Stone |
| ------------- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Fortress      | 1     |       |       |
| HoK upgrade   | 1     | 720   | 240   |
| Lab. Quarters | 1     | 35    | 12    |
| Fortress      | 2     | 150   | 50    |
| HoK upgrade   | 2     | 1408  | 448   |
| Lab. Quarters | 2     | 138   | 46    |
| Fortress      | 3     | 440   | 140   |
| HoK upgrade   | 3     | 2640  | 800   |
| Lab. Quarters | 3     | 406   | 129   |
| Fortress      | 4     | 1100  | 333   |
| HoK upgrade   | 4     | 4800  | 1536  |
| Lab. Quarters | 4     | 1015  | 308   |
| Fortress      | 5     | 2500  | 800   |
| HoK upgrade   | 5     | 9600  | 3200  |
| Lab. Quarters | 5     | 2308  | 738   |
| Fortress      | 6     | 6000  | 2000  |
| HoK upgrade   | 6     | 18400 | 6080  |
| Lab. Quarters | 6     | 5538  | 1849  |

​    Ambitious guilds often skip building of everything up to HoK 6 (costs ~132 mushrooms) at the very start of the server. That helps them to reach total guild HoK of 300 as early as day #2 of server. And HoK 300 means +100 stats for your gems (compared to HoK 0).

​    Next most important buildings to have at that early stage are only the frst level of Gem Mine and levels 1-5 of Woodcutter and Stone Quarry:

>  （表格略）

​    Gem Mine is necessary as this is where you find gems, and equipping gems in socketed items gives them additional attribute points (stats). Once you unlock gems you should try to wear only socketed items, even if they are not epic, as a normal socketed item is better than an epic item with no socket (unless the non-epic item has wrong attributes, or is older, or your guild has too low HoK).

​    You need a decent level of Woodcutter and Stone Quarry in order to become an attractive target for others to attack, thus having more chances to counter-attack others yourself.

And in order to do any attacks at all, you also need a decent level of Barracks too. Each level of barracks gives you 3 soldiers. It takes 10 minutes to rebuild a single soldier, so, if you have Barracks 6, it would be enough to make 18 fortress attacks once per 3 hours,
without losing a single chance for attack.

> 表格略

​    All buildings listed above cost 66 201 wood and 23 320 stone, so once those are ready, you will have some materials left for Fortress 7 and Laborers’ Quarters 7 too.

   After the inital 48 protection on new servers, your main source of wood and stone become fortress attacks, Fortress events and wheel of fortune (dice too,but after you unlock Tower). Woodcutter and Stone Quarry are only relevant as a means to attract others. You can read more on that in section “Fortress attacks after 48-h protection”.

#### 2.3 Catches

   Keep Gem Mine at level 1 As mentioned above you need Gem Mine level 1 early. As early as you can.

   Gems are important, but there is a gotcha that catches many players. Often new players assume that the higher the level of the mine, the better. It is, but not early in the game. Upgrading Gem Mine before level 70 (even to level 2) is considered a mistake, and truly slows you down.

   Each level of Gem Mine slightly improves the stats of the gems you receive, but there is a trade of. With each next level the price of gems increases (they cost more gold, wood and stone), and so does the time required to mine them.

For example, with Gem Mine level 1 a single gem costs 150 gold, 2 wood and 1 stone, and takes 42 minutes to find a gem (with Laborers’ Quarters level 6, also called just Lab). In comparision, with Gem Mine level 6 gems cost 900 gold, 400 wood and 133 stone,and take 5 hours and 36 minutes to harvest (with same level of Lab).

   As you can see the time needed to find a gem inflates a lot with each next level, which means you get less gems. Unfortunately you can’t use all gems, as only some gems are suitable for your character. That means you could have waited for hours for a single gem only to find it is for the wrong class (yep, the RNG god often gives you gems for other classes, or luck gems, which are considered useless).

  What’s worse, the gold price also inflates a lot, and before level 50 you will find it hard to collect enough even for the gems that cost only 150 gold. Early in the game you level up quickly and need that gold for so many other things (guild skills, stats, starting raids, buying epics).

​    And on top of all that, the more time needed to mine a gem, the more expensive it is to skip waiting with mushrooms. This is the very reason why fast-leveling try-hard players keep Gem Mine at level 1 until their character reaches 215-225 level. To level up quickly they need to change gems very often, and having the mine at level 1 means that skipping a single gem costs only a few mushrooms.

​    **Don’t upgrade Smithy beyond level 9**. At server start, don’t rush to build the Smithy yet. Do that only when you can’t win enough attacks anymore (usually around the time you have Fortress 10-11 ready).

​    Level 9 of Smithy allows you to upgrade your soldiers to level 70, and at that level training one soldier costs 346 wood and 112 stone. At the beginning of a new server level 70 is more than adequate to defeat just enough opponents, and the cost of the soldiers is low enough to allow you to attack opponents that give no resources, just to force a change of the opponent.

​    You might even manage to do just fine without ever building Smithy. Possible if you manage to find active players to exchange fortress counter-attacks with, as long as those players have no defenses (no one should, right?).

#### 2.4 Fortress attacks after first 48-h

After the initial protection on the server is over, your main source of wood and stone become:

- Fortress attacks and counter-attacks
- Rewards from quests during Fortress event (the Fantastic Fortress Festivity event)\
- The 20 spins at wheel of fortune (especially during Fortress events, as reward is x2)
- The dice game (after you unlock Tower)

​    Fortress attacks give much more wood and stone than you could collect from the Woodcutter or Stone Quarry. Each server is different in that regard, but still it’s pretty common to regularly find fortress attacks that give more than 4K wood and 1K stone:

​    But to make use of that you need to attack other fortresses multiple times per day. How often depends on the level of your Barracks. As was already explained earlier, each level of Barracks give you 3 soldiers, and you want a minimum of 18 soldiers in order to not lose any chances for attacks, while keeping your sanity by not having to make those too often.

​    Always attack with 1 soldier (only use more soldiers, if it gives lots of resources).

   If attack is going to fail with 1 solider, and no gold is required to change the opponent, do that.

​    If changing the opponent costs gold, do NOT do that.

​    Instead, go to MAIL BATTLES (B from keyboard) and find a Fortress defense to counter-attack with 1 soldier. By doing a counter-attack you gain resources, and also change the opponent for free. Always check Fortress defenses from the bottom of the list first, cause the bottom ones disappear first.

​    Or, since scrolling to the bottom is still kind of slow, pin all Fortress defenses to the top of the list.

​    Then counter-attack them, starting from the top.

  After that check again what is the next available Fortress attack (F from keyboard). If it would be successful with 1 soldier, do that. If not, go to MAIL→BATTLES again, unpin the one you just did, and choose the next one to counter-attack. Repeat until you have no soldiers left and start training new soldiers. Training a soldier takes 10 minutes, so if you have Barracks 6, you can take a deserved brake and come back to do counter-attacks again in 3 hours.

​    Make this a routine and soon you will know by heart the names of the players that give the most resources. If you need a simple example on what attacks to look for, try to find ones that give 1K stone or more, or at least close to that.

  Some of the players that you attack will start to counter-attack you too, as long as your woodcutter and stone quarry are leveled up enough (eg. at least to lvl 10). That way you will both have more chances for counter-attacks.

Players often ask why one would want others to attack his fortress at all. The reason is that when someone attacks you, he receives more resources than you actually lose. You only lose 50% of the resources in your woodcutter and quarry (as long as you have protection), but the player attacking you  is given an extra bonus. This bonus is not taken from you and depends on the level of your resource buildings. Same happens when you attack someone else. So by constantly counter-attacking each other, you both earn that extra bonus, which is much more than what you lose.

​    When you have no soldiers, but notice a Fortress defense that would give lots of resources, use the pin button to save it for later. Pinned defenses move to
the top and won’t be lost when the list is overwritten with new messages.

#### 2.5 Maximizing wood/stone rewards
